# Automatic-Number-Plate-detection-System

Automatic License/Number Plate Recognition (ANPR/ALPR) is a process involving the following steps:

Step #1: Detect and localize a license plate in an input image/frame
Step #2: Extract the characters from the license plate
Step #3: Apply some form of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to recognize the extracted characters
ANPR tends to be an extremely challenging subfield of computer vision, due to the vast diversity and assortment of license plate types across states and countries.

License plate recognition systems are further complicated by:

Dynamic lighting conditions including reflections, shadows, and blurring
Fast-moving vehicles
Obstructions
